# SensorNetworks_SoSe2023

Topic of this exam is the (partial) modelling of a sensor network (see picture below).

The diagram shows the classes, their relationships and only a subset of attributes and methods related to sensor calibration. You can find all attributes and methods in the class definitions. The comments there also describe the classes and methods in detail.

## Exercise

Implement the classes and their methods as described in the header files. Adding private methods in order to avoid redundant code is allowed. Adding to or modifying the classes’ attributes is forbidden. Adding to or modifying the public or protected methods is forbidden as well. Implement the tests outlined in file “test.cpp”. Note that “assert that …” means that you have to write one or more assertTrue(...)-statements. Unless there is an error, running your tests must not produce any output on the console.
